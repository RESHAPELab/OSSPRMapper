3583,moe sync,this code has been reviewed and submitted internally. feel free to discuss on the pr and we can submit follow-up changes as necessary.  commits: ===== <p> release the input futures as soon as we submit the combiner task. but really  redo how we release resources in general.  this is a followup to cl 265489523  which  only  released the input futures as soon as the combiner task finished running (which had often happened even before that cl but hadn t if the combiner returned a future that was still pending). that cl was good enough for practical purposes  but i wanted to better understand how we release resources.  this cl standardizes on aggregatefuture.releaseresources() as the way to null out all fields[*]  merging logic from releaseresources()  releaseresourcesafterfailure()  and asynccallableinterruptibletask.setvalue(). as part of that  it merges aggregatefuture and aggregatefuturestate/runningstate into a single object.  [*] ok  except seenexceptions  which gets its own handling. as a bonus  i believe that this cl clears seenexceptions earlier than it used to be cleared in the combinedfuture case. specifically  it clears it when all inputs   rather than when the combiner task has finished running.  it turns out that blindly nulling out fields is too aggressive  so we need to be careful in 2 cases:  1. combinedfuture.releaseresources() can t null out  task  until the future is done or the task is done running. that s because it may need to interrupt the task. to handle this  i don t null out  task  in releaseresources() unless isdone(). to ensure that  task  still gets nulled out as soon as it s done running  i null it out directly in afterraninterruptibly(). (ok  this is another exception to my claim that releaseresources() handles nulling out  all  fields.)  2. even if the output future is done  processcompleted() sometimes needs access to the original futures in order to see whether any of them failed. to handle this  i store them in the listener and pass them through to processcompleted() (when necessary).  the changes to prod code are net negative in line count  at least ignoring the added comments. i ve also added a couple tests  only one of which passed before this cl. and i think the model for when fields are nulled out is overall clearer after this cl. so hopefully this cl is a step forward  despite the complexity of the changes and the remaining complexity in the code. (i also included a few unrelated simplifications  like not bothering to check collectsvalues before calling collectonevalue(...).)  (aside: this cl s releaseresources() is like our proposed aftercommit() api but different. first  releaseresources() may be called even before set() or setasync() in the combinedfuture case. second  combinedfuture may rely on the fact that it s called twice in some cases: it s called once when all inputs complete  but it doesn t null out  task   and then it can be called again if the output is cancelled  at which point it *does* null out  task . but that probably doesn t matter too much because the task was probably handed to an executor in the meantime  so combinedfuture is unlikely to hold the final reference to it. anyway  for more discussion of aftercommit()  see     41a8adb81e2ebf27e9d85f70671ff8f97fd7721b,DB,IO,Interpreter,Logic,Test,Util,i18n

(that is  we re the ones who implement runnable.run().) we re catching exceptions (and thus any rejectedexecutionexception) in the obvious places. occasionally we do call listeners  but naturally we do that only after completing the future or at least calling setfuture (after which a stray setexception(rejectedexecutionexception) would be a no-op).  the one(?) exception to that is that interruptibletask.run() can call currentthread.interrupt()  which we learned a few years ago can call arbitrary code through nio callbacks. at some point  though  i throw my hands up and say  whatever.   (if the interrupt were to be a problem  it would have to be with an executor that executes tasks inline  like directexecutor. but i note that rejectionpropagatingexecutor  at least  already defends against this for directexecutor itself (by skipping the rejectedexecutionexception logic entirely). so the danger exists only with combinedfutureinterruptibletask or with a non-directexecutor that can execute tasks inline without catching exceptions -- and again  only in concert with nio interrupt callbacks. i think.)  238c383c13d05a75bb6b590f1542e5f4b11f0634  -------  <p> add @donotmock to traverser.  relnotes=add @donotmock to traverser  83e545cd90bbd64b71ac66ff51267bca670bf8f9,IO,Interpreter,Logic,Test,Util

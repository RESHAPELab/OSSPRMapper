15,make (un)abbreviating journal titles also work on the journaltitle field,i ve (i) added the toggle button to the  journaltitle  field editor and (ii) made the abbreviate/unabbreviate actions change both the  journal  and  journaltitle  fields. the latter might be a bit simple-minded --  should the field to consider depend on whether biblatex mode is actually turned on?,App,Logging,Util
18,fix edits getting lost in biblatex mode,this fixes a bug where edits made in a field on a compressedentryeditortab wouldn t get stored when the field editor lost focus. the bug was caused by entryeditortabfocuslistener accessing the unused inherited parent field of compressedentryeditortab instances instead of the latter class s own (private) parent field. instead of doing just a quick fix  i decided to eliminate the excessive code and data duplication in the two classes altogether and consolidate them into one class (with an additional flag to the constructor)  since i don t think an extra class is warranted here (and easily and sensibly implementable by derivation).,Network,UI,Util,Logging,IO,interpreter,App
19,fix error when setting unset field in source panel,when the user tries to set a previously unset field of an entry via the source panel of the entry editor  the program complains with an error message and refuses to store the field values. this change fixes that behaviour.,UI,App,Logging,interpreter,IO,Util
22,extended the  unknown entry type  error message,i had problems locating which entry had this unknown entry type and hence extended the error message to also include the bibtex key.,App,IO,Util,Logging
24,extend biblatex: support for alias fields,- added support for aliased fields. for example  the content in the  journaltitle  field is also shown in the  journal  table. - added cleanup option to convert to the new biblatex format - modified the required/optional fields for biblatex entries to reflect the above changes (the  year  field is no longer required),App
27,partial fix for bug #913,realized many fields were not being exported  not only in .csv and .ods formats as stated in the bug report  but in .sxc as well. i fixed the export for both .ods and .sxc  but couldn t figure out how to fix it for .csv.,Util,interpreter,Network,Logging,App

47,added the ability to reorder the panels in the side pane.,side pane panels now feature an up arrow button and a down arrow button immediately to the left of the close button. these buttons allow panes to be swapped with the pane above or below them  respectively.  whenever the panes are reordered  the current position of each visible pane is recorded in the application preferences  so the user s custom ordering can be preserved when jabref is next run.,Util,App
48,add the option to save selected entries as plain bibtex.,adds a new menu option called  save selected as plain bibtex  .  this option behaves the same way as the existing  save selected as   option  except that the jabref metadata and signature comment are not written to the resulting output file.,App,UI,IO,Logging,Util
49,minor ui fix: add  save selected as plain bibtex  to the list of open database-only actions.,the  save selected as plain bibtex  menu option is now correctly enabled and disabled based on whether or not a database is currently open.  i haven t included a changelog entry  since this commit effectively just corrects a minor oversight on my behalf when adding this menu entry in [a previous pull request](  but i m happy to add one if deemed necessary.,UI,Logging,App,IO,Util
55,mac bundle and integration for java 7,these changes creates a new compilation target for jabref  in order to make a mac application bundle which can work with the newer oracle jvm for mac (versions 7 and 8)  and change the code of the wrapper to integrate the apple events with the non-deprecated api in com.apple.eawt.  main changes are: - create a new target based on oracle s appbundler to create a bundle compatible with newer jvms. (not compatible with apple s jvm). - move the older target to jabref-legacy.app. - remove the old deprecated wrapper osxadapter  which does not work with oracle s jvm. - create new wrapper based on com.apple.eawt (compatible with both jvms). - improve the quit behaviour. - add support for the fullscreen feature.  the code changes are compatible with both oracle s jvms and apple legacy one  but the legacy bundle is currently broken as the code requires java 1.7+. tested with apple s jvm (1.6.0_65) and oracle s jvm (1.8.0_45).,Logging,UI,App,IO,Util

89,removes splash screen,this pr removes both the splash screen and the cli option to disable the splash screen.   why? - splash screen on modern systems is shown only for a very short period of time as jabref starts fast - we should focus on making jabref to start as fast as possible. a splash screen reduces the time to start the software as additional code needs to be executed.  - for each new version (even for beta and dev versions)  we have to check in a png with 200kb file size into the repository. this increases the amount of storage required for the git repository by 200kb for each version/dev-version. - the splash screen interferes with using jabref via the cli.  - it reduces code in jabref. hence  less code needs to be maintained.  this is a pr that is open for discussion. please add any pros/cons as you see fit.,Logging,App,Util,interpreter
93,logic improvements (java 1.7+),this pull request features various improvements of the classes in the logic package with the aim to transition beyond java 1.6 and improve quality. in particular: - updates license headers with current date - syntax optimizations: java 1.7 use of generics (diamond operator) - format code according to java conventions (c-style curly brackets  i am looking at you) - improves exception handling with logging - replace usages of exception with more precise exceptions - improves variable names - removes commented-out code  unused private methods (unused public methods/constructors are not eliminated) - use try-with-resources if possible - delete stale comments - replace stringbuffer with stringbuilder - remove history information from javadoc  (i am aware that i could push this directly  since i am now a contributor. as this started out as a pull request  i want to finish it as such. future cotributions will be made directly to jabref/master),Test
99,rewrite doi parsing,i rewrote the doi parser as it was hard to understand and missing quite a few valid dois. it s not 100% but should be a lot better than before. - clearer and more permissive regex - better url encoding and decoding - more test coverage  any comments before merging this into master are appreciated.,App

105,move jabrefframe and basepanel to the gui package,this pull request moves the two central gui classes   jabrefframe  and  basepanel  to the gui package.   to preserve visibility constraints  this requires the relocation of many more classes that have package-local dependencies on the above two classes.   variables / methods in  jabrefframe  with reduced visibility that are accessed from  jabref  were made  public   since the latter class clearly does not belong to the gui package.,APM,Logic,Logging,Util,i18n,DB,IO,Network,App,interpreter,UI
108,extract model package with core data classes,this pull request extracts the most central data classes from the root package and puts them into a separate model package. it was possible to remove all gui dependencies from these classes.  additionally  all classes in the model package are refactored and adjusted to java 8 syntax.,Util

147,remove option to set custom icon theme,the setting of a custom icon theme is not available in the gui. because of this  i removed it.   what is changed: - no support for custom icon themes anymore - a smaller guiglobals class - more explicit referencing of icons - less setup logic that is required to be called explicitly - when no icon is available  the default one (red.png at the moment) will be used. this allows to detect icon errors -> see below - less code  uncovered issues through this change: - the action openfolder is used in the icon bar  but as it had no icon  it was never displayed to the user. this is now marked explicitly in red  allowing us developers to fix this.  i am open for feedback.,Network,App,Util,UI,Logging,IO
150,removes the legacy-action integrity check,removes the **legacy**-action  tools--> legacy tools --> integrity check  with all its files.   what it helps: - removes 1000 lines of code - removes a feature that is marked as a legacy tool  what does the feature do at the moment: - check year: raise error if it contains a 4digit number - check title: warn only about wrong braces - check author/editor: check that the structure is correct using  and  and the     separator.  anyone who wants this feature to stay?  is there any other validation facility in place where we could add the checks instead?,Network,IO,App,Interpreter,UI,Util,interpreter,Logging

572,refactor cleanup code,this pr (again) refactors the cleanup department. the motivation was to extract as much logic as possible from the cleanup action to make it easier to use cleanup operations also at different points (like on save).  biggest changes: - move preferences controlling the cleanup process to own data class  cleanuppreset  and the execution of the cleanup process to  cleanupworker . thus starting a cleanup process is reduced to setting up a proper preset and passing it to the worker. - move code displaying and changing a preset to a separate class. hence it is now easy to show and change a preset at a different place (like in the preferences).  - move preferences code to  jabrefpreferences . well  this is the place where it belongs. - add tests for the  cleanupworker . more detailed tests of the different cleanup processes are still missing.  todo s/breaking changes: these are all related to the fact that there is no nice interface to get/set the file field of an entry (all the code is in the gui class filelisttablemodel). - the counting of unsuccessful renames does not work anymore (i vote for removing this completely) - remove cleanuputil and incorperate the code in the respective cleanup classes. currently this code relies on gui code (filelisttablemodel) and thus cannot easily be moved to logic. - test the file related cleanups.,Network,App,Util,Logging,IO,Test,UI

718,improve database writer,the aim of this pr is to improve the database writer  in particular 621 and #669.  also add tests to the writer and parser (and do some refactorings to make test writing easier).  changes (to serialization): - 621 and #669 by adding new lines after encoding and preamble. the idea is that everything is terminated by a new line and the parsed serialization only safes newlines which separate it from the previous entry.  - comments and preamble are serialized with capitalized first letter  i.e.  @comment  instead of  @comment  and  @preamble  instead of  @preamble . this should follow the convention for entries. - there is no space anymore between  @string  and the bracket and after the bracket  i.e.  @string{name = {string}}  instead of  @string { name = {string} }  - implemented 756]( add possibility to reformat all entries on save (under preferences  file)  refactorings: - renamed fileactions to bibdatabasewriter - merged code for export and save in bibdatabasewriter - extracted savesettings class from fileactions to own file and extended it (& renamed to savepreferences). note that this class has some setters (against the recently established convention for preference classes) since there are quite a few cases where the values from the preferences have to be overriden.  - change usage of arrays to list in many places - remove unused boolean parameters checksearch  checkgroup - moved writing of metadata and customentrytypesmanager to bibdatabasewriter - extracted and reused gui code for displaying and editing sort preferences (saveorderconfigdisplay),App,UI,Logging,IO,Util

1207,restructure importers,the aim of this pr is to reduce the overlap between the importer package and some code in gui (in particular  the class opendatabaseaction). moreover  #1080 and #1153 are fixed.  in detail  the following things were changed: - the abstract  importformat  class is almost completely rewritten. please have a look at this class. almost all other changes are a direct consequence of the edits made to the importformat class. the biggest change is that the import method returns a  parserresult  instead of a list of entries (in this way  metadata can also be imported and error messages are communicated more effectively instead of throwing ioexceptions). moreover  the import method operates on a reader instead of an input stream in order to reduce some common code in all importers. -  add method  importdatabase(path file  charset encoding)  to the importer interface which opens the file and passes the stream to the other import method. - the bibteximporter overwrites this new import method and uses the logic from  opendatabaseaction.loaddatabase  to determine the encoding of the bib file. - change opendatabaseaction to operate against the bibtex importer.  - remove get/set iscustomimporter: was not really used (just for sorting - now everything is alphabetical) - empty entries are no longer imported (thus a few test had to be changed)  remark: the methods getextension and getdescription are not implemented by almost any importer. this should be done. maybe this is something for the stupro?

1215,improved conversion maps and conversion speed,the html/unicode <-> latex conversion map source was based on regular expressions making it a jungle of backslashes. now  replace is used instead of replaceall so fewer backslashes and (theoretically) a bit faster.  i also added benchmarking for the following conversions: - html to latex (used at import  cleanup and save action) - latex to html (used for preview) - latex to unicode (used for table rendering)   and i got a slight improvement  although i cannot really tell why the two latter are faster now as they are based on cleaned versions one reason might be that the tests are based on latex symbols with more backslashes in them for the old case  before: benchmarks.htmltolatexconversion      5533.070 ▒   86.148  ops/s benchmarks.latextohtmlconversion     141500.226 ▒ 8011.038  ops/s benchmarks.latextounicodeconversion  124527.930 ▒ 3984.776  ops/s  after: benchmarks.htmltolatexconversion     6153.450 ▒   114.716  ops/s benchmarks.latextohtmlconversion     168037.040 ▒ 13412.341  ops/s benchmarks.latextounicodeconversion  173674.308 ▒  7455.006  ops/s  here one can see that only searching the string to be converted once is far better than running replace on all possible characters. which is not surprising  but require quite complicated code.  finally  with the simpler strings it was easier to add most (all?) of the curly brackets required to solve #405 .,Util

1471,preserve user comments in bib file,so i am finally having my take at #1026. the current solution was surprisingly easy so far (despite what i had written before). it looks explicitly for our encoding prefix in the file ( encoding:  ) and kills lines that contain it (but only lines preceding an entry  it will not delete something that is inside an entry). other user comments are left untouched and are _always_ written out again  even if the entry is reformatted.  user comments that are above meta data  bibtex strings  or the preamble will still be removed  though. changing that would require large scale changes to these items in our model  since we would also need to store the parsed serialization for them  which we do not do so far.  this should receive significant automated  but also manual  testing  since it modifies a quite critical part and has the potential to destroy bib files. i will add a few more tests for this pr. -   -,Test,Util,IO,App

1552,performance improvements for groups,the bibentry now stores a list of words which are contained in the field. in this way the keywordgroup.ismatch method just has to compare two arrays instead of analyzing strings over and over again. for a big file (> 7000 entries  > 100 groups) the load time decreased by 1 sec from 4.8 seconds to 3.7. half of the time needed for showing the groups tree is spent in calculating the number of hits. moreover  subsequent rerendings of the groups tree (for example after changing an entry) are also quicker.  note that the match algorithm changed slightly. for example  previously looking for  test  in  some$test  resulted in a match  this is no longer the case. however  normal word separators (like whitespace  comma and semicolon are recognized properly)  i.e. searching for  test  in  some test  returns true.  also fixed a npe. -   -   -   (),interpreter,App,Util

3583,moe sync,this code has been reviewed and submitted internally. feel free to discuss on the pr and we can submit follow-up changes as necessary.  commits: ===== <p> release the input futures as soon as we submit the combiner task. but really  redo how we release resources in general.  this is a followup to cl 265489523  which  only  released the input futures as soon as the combiner task finished running (which had often happened even before that cl but hadn t if the combiner returned a future that was still pending). that cl was good enough for practical purposes  but i wanted to better understand how we release resources.  this cl standardizes on aggregatefuture.releaseresources() as the way to null out all fields[*]  merging logic from releaseresources()  releaseresourcesafterfailure()  and asynccallableinterruptibletask.setvalue(). as part of that  it merges aggregatefuture and aggregatefuturestate/runningstate into a single object.  [*] ok  except seenexceptions  which gets its own handling. as a bonus  i believe that this cl clears seenexceptions earlier than it used to be cleared in the combinedfuture case. specifically  it clears it when all inputs   rather than when the combiner task has finished running.  it turns out that blindly nulling out fields is too aggressive  so we need to be careful in 2 cases:  1. combinedfuture.releaseresources() can t null out  task  until the future is done or the task is done running. that s because it may need to interrupt the task. to handle this  i don t null out  task  in releaseresources() unless isdone(). to ensure that  task  still gets nulled out as soon as it s done running  i null it out directly in afterraninterruptibly(). (ok  this is another exception to my claim that releaseresources() handles nulling out  all  fields.)  2. even if the output future is done  processcompleted() sometimes needs access to the original futures in order to see whether any of them failed. to handle this  i store them in the listener and pass them through to processcompleted() (when necessary).  the changes to prod code are net negative in line count  at least ignoring the added comments. i ve also added a couple tests  only one of which passed before this cl. and i think the model for when fields are nulled out is overall clearer after this cl. so hopefully this cl is a step forward  despite the complexity of the changes and the remaining complexity in the code. (i also included a few unrelated simplifications  like not bothering to check collectsvalues before calling collectonevalue(...).)  (aside: this cl s releaseresources() is like our proposed aftercommit() api but different. first  releaseresources() may be called even before set() or setasync() in the combinedfuture case. second  combinedfuture may rely on the fact that it s called twice in some cases: it s called once when all inputs complete  but it doesn t null out  task   and then it can be called again if the output is cancelled  at which point it *does* null out  task . but that probably doesn t matter too much because the task was probably handed to an executor in the meantime  so combinedfuture is unlikely to hold the final reference to it. anyway  for more discussion of aftercommit()  see     41a8adb81e2ebf27e9d85f70671ff8f97fd7721b,Util,Test,App

(that is  we re the ones who implement runnable.run().) we re catching exceptions (and thus any rejectedexecutionexception) in the obvious places. occasionally we do call listeners  but naturally we do that only after completing the future or at least calling setfuture (after which a stray setexception(rejectedexecutionexception) would be a no-op).  the one(?) exception to that is that interruptibletask.run() can call currentthread.interrupt()  which we learned a few years ago can call arbitrary code through nio callbacks. at some point  though  i throw my hands up and say  whatever.   (if the interrupt were to be a problem  it would have to be with an executor that executes tasks inline  like directexecutor. but i note that rejectionpropagatingexecutor  at least  already defends against this for directexecutor itself (by skipping the rejectedexecutionexception logic entirely). so the danger exists only with combinedfutureinterruptibletask or with a non-directexecutor that can execute tasks inline without catching exceptions -- and again  only in concert with nio interrupt callbacks. i think.)  238c383c13d05a75bb6b590f1542e5f4b11f0634  -------  <p> add @donotmock to traverser.  relnotes=add @donotmock to traverser  83e545cd90bbd64b71ac66ff51267bca670bf8f9,Network,IO,Util,App,Logging
